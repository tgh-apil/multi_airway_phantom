# Multi Airway Phantom

A multipurpose airway training phantom, created using 3D printing. This phantom can be used to practice inserting a scope into a tumorless trachea, or configured to partially compress the trachea, simulating the presence of tumors. It can also be used to practice the insertion of a tracheostomy tube. See how-to-use guide and assembly instructions below.

This model was developed at the [Lynn & Arnold Irwin Advanced Perioperative Imaging Lab](https://apil.ca/), Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network.

## How-to-Use Guide
#### Tumor Anatomy
* To compress the trachea, insert key(s) into the trachea cover and lock into place by twisting the key 90 degrees until it slots into the groove on the underside of the cover. 
* It may be easier to do the above step by first removing the trachea base. To do so: first detach the connector tube from the back of the head, then disconnect it from the trachea. Lift the trachea base up and out of the groove in the base plate. Insert and lock the key(s) as desired and place the trachea base back into its groove. Reattach the connector tube to the trachea, then reattach the other end to the back of the head.

#### Normal Anatomy
* Before inserting scope, ensure all tumor keys have been removed from the trachea cover so that the trachea is uncompressed.

#### Tracheostomy
* The tracheostomy portion of the phantom is independent of whether or not the tumor keys have been locked into the cover. Insert the tracheostomy tube through the opening on the phantom's neck.

#### Other
* 4 push-in rubber bumpers — 1/2" ID, 1” high stem — https://www.mcmaster.com/9310K16/
* 3 zip ties
* 9 M4 screws (4 - 40mm long, 5 - 18mm long)

### Materials
* PLA, PETG, or a similarly rigid 3D printing filament
* TPE (flexible) filament, specifically for the trachea, tracheostomy port, and tumor key tip

### Equipment
* 3D printer (a Prusa i3 MK3 printer was used here)
* Drill 

## Assembly Instructions
1. Print out the printed components. Each part only needs to be printed once per model, except for the tumor keys and tumor key tips, which can be printed more times to create more complex tumor anatomy if desired.
2. Insert a rubber foot into each of the 4 holes on the bottom of the back plate.
3. Attach the tracheostomy port to the head with two 12mm long M3 screws.
4. Attach the head to the chest wall with four 40mm long M4 screws.
5. Insert the chest wall into the grooves along the sides of the base plate.
6. Attach the trachea base plate cover to the base plate with five 18mm long M4 screws.
7. Insert the trachea into the base plate and align it with the groove in the base plate. Secure it with 3 zip ties.
8. Insert the tip of the key into the tumor tip. If desired, configure the tumor placement by inserting and locking keys into the base plate.
9. Place the base plate into the grooves on the back plate.
10. Insert the connector tube over the open end of the trachea, then connect the connector tube with the hole in the back of the head.
